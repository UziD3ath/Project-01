  <p>This video helped me relive my childhood and reminded me of the older joys in life and how Minecraft was a big part of my journey of gaming</p>
  <p>Another video of a old memory of minecraft and how the community shaped my experiences</p>
  <p>The community in Minecraft helped me a lot in discovering a way to connect with others and experience friendships and learning more about others and of course making memories</p>

 <h2>Reason as to why these videos</h2>
  <p>The reason I've included these videos is how they impacted my view of the internet</p>
  <p>Another reason being is that these videos both invoke nostalgia and joy simply by watching them which is quite hard to do in today's time</p>
  <p>Overall these videos shaped my view on a lot of things but another thing which changed me is a anime named Vinland Saga, I've included a small part of it as example</p>
