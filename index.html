  <h1>A brief intro</h1>
   <p>Hi! I am Uzair Ali and I'm a resident of Pakistan. 
	  I love to play games and read occasionally and dabble in writing as well as some image editing along with proofreading.
	  Currently I'm taking part in this course in order to learn something about web development and maybe make a career in it.</p>
